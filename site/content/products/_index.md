        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Create new type of museum, museum on demand. By using mixed reality devices
    in museum environments we replace physical collection of artifacts with
    holographic projections. Dynamic update of projected museum artifacts and
    multi user overview of projections. Let the user pre-select museum exhibit
    even before visiting museum. His collection will wait upon arrival into
    physical museum space.

    Create your own product showcase and retail experience in Mixed reality
    using the Revisum XR platform.  If you want to present a new line of
    products, it is possible to create reports where each user spent most of the
    time (per product and per point of interest) Points of interests are areas
    that are predefined for each product.
