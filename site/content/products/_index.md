        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Create new type of museum, museum on demand. By using mixed reality devices
    in museum environments we replace physical collection of artifacts with
    holographic projections. Dynamic update of projected museum artifacts and
    multi user overview of projections. Let the user pre-select museum exhibit
    even before visiting museum. His collection will wait upon arrival into
    physical museum space.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
