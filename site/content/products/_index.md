        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, weâ€™re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

    Create new type of museum, museum on demand. By using mixed reality devices
    in museum environments we replace physical collection of artifacts with
    holographic projections. Dynamic update of projected museum artifacts and
    multi user overview of projections. Let the user pre-select museum exhibit
    even before visiting museum. His collection will wait upon arrival into
    physical museum space.

    Create your own product showcase and retail experience in Mixed reality
    using the Revisum XR platform.  If you want to present a new line of
    products, it is possible to create reports where each user spent most of the
    time (per product and per point of interest) Points of interests are areas
    that are predefined for each product.
